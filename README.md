Dive into the cosmic realm of **Space Invasion!** 🌠

**🛸 Role:** You're the captain of a spaceship, armed with laser beams, defending the universe against alien invaders.

**🔥 Features:**

**Laser Beams: **
Your primary weapon! These beams interact with all scrollable objects but unleash their true power against the "Avoid" objects - the menacing aliens.
**Power-Ups: **
Collect these to boost your score and health. But remember, tokens (RareGets) only regenerate health when you're on the brink of defeat (HP < 3).
**Adaptive Difficulty: **
For every 10 aliens you defeat, the game's pace intensifies, challenging your reflexes and strategies.
**Victory Goal: **Achieve a cosmic score of 2000 to claim victory!

Play it safe, gather power-ups, and avoid confrontations for a steady journey.
Or, go guns blazing, ramp up the difficulty, and either win faster or face a swift defeat. The universe's fate is in your hands!

**📢 Heads Up:** The challenge escalates rapidly. Brace yourself!
